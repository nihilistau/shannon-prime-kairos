"""MEMORY TRIAGE — separate real memories from the voice/ASR test corpus.

The registry is 405 rows, 404 of them framed "The user said: ...", and most of them
are TEMPLATE-GENERATED speech-test sentences, not memories:

    "The kind nurse painted the tall building as the sun went down."
    "A lonely sailor polished the garden as the church bells rang."
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    "Transcribe the audio exactly."

They were captured by the B4 nightshift growth lane during voice testing and have been
polluting recall ever since (this is what makes an unrelated memory surface mid-answer).

REVERSIBLE BY CONSTRUCTION: nothing is deleted. Rows are partitioned into
    var/memory/registry.jsonl        (keep)
    var/memory/quarantine.jsonl      (test corpus — restorable)
and the original is backed up to registry.jsonl.bak-<ts>.

Run:  python tools/memory/triage.py           # dry run, prints the split
      python tools/memory/triage.py --apply   # writes
