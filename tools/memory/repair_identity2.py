"""REPAIR #2 — she overwrote his GENDER this time, and ate her own tool output.

Found live, hours after the NAME fix:

    ep_tool_1783880554158  "I am a woman"                     speaker=user class=identity LIVE
      -> superseded "I am male"                                (his, retired)
    ep_tool_1783880561704  "remember -> stored: I am a woman"  speaker=user src="user turn"

TWO BUGS, BOTH ALREADY "FIXED" ONCE:

1. THE FIREWALL WAS THE INSTANCE, NOT THE CLASS. It guarded her NAME, because her name is
   what had eaten his. Her GENDER walked straight through the same door, into the same
   lane, and supersede did exactly what it is built to do. The store then asserted that
   KNACK IS A WOMAN.

2. SHE WAS EATING HER OWN EXHAUST. Capture took "the last message with role=user" — but
   agent_chat_stream runs mutate_messages=True on the console path, and the Gemma tool
   protocol feeds a tool RESULT back as a role=user message. So after any tool call, "the
   last user message" was HER OWN TOOL RECEIPT. A write produced an output, the output
   looked like the user talking, and the output got written.

   A protocol role is not a speaker.

Both are fixed at the source (lifecycle.admit_to_user_store now covers every value that
constitutes her; _capture_after_turn is HANDED the human's text, taken before the tool
loop can touch the list). This repairs the rows they left behind.
