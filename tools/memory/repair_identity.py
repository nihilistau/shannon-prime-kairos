"""REPAIR THE IDENTITY SLOT — undo the supersede that renamed the user.

WHAT HAPPENED (2026-07-12, caused by a gate run, found in the live registry):

    ep_tool_1783829466931   "My name is Shannon."   speaker=user  class=identity  LIVE
      supersedes:
        ep_live_m1783583016468   "The user said: my name is Knack"
        ep_live_m1783815036340   "My name is Knack"
        ep_tool_1783829324670    "The user's name is Knack"

G-RECALL-PRECISION asked her "what is your name?". She answered "My name is Shannon."
— correctly. Then that sentence went into memory through remember(), which is the USER
store, so it was stamped speaker=user. classify() read "name is" and called it identity.
find_superseded() then did exactly what it is built to do: an identity fact for the same
speaker with a different value RETIRES the old one. All three rows saying the user is
Knack were tombstoned.

The store now asserts that the user's name is Shannon. The gate still "passed" (she
answered 'Knack.') because recall found his name in other rows — the identity slot was
already wrong and the gate could not see it. That is a gate that measures the wrong thing.

This script repairs the DATA. The write-path guard that stops it recurring is separate —
data repair without the guard is just waiting for the next turn.
