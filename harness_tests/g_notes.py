"""G-NOTES — the board: store, lifecycle, tools, and the promise.

A note is not a fact, and the whole feature turns on that. The fact store's admission gate
is deliberately brutal — a durable fact must assert a standing state about a person — and
it would refuse almost every note ever written ("buy a 3090 if stock returns" asserts
nothing standing about anybody). Put notes in the fact store and either the gate refuses
them or you loosen the gate and the firehose comes back. So: same MEM-OKF spine, own lane.

THE PROMISE is the part that must not break. He asks to be reminded; she says she will.
If that reminder silently fails to fire, he finds out by missing the thing — and a feature
he TRUSTED and that quietly lied to him is worse than no feature. So the reminder path is
gated harder than anything else here: it fires, it fires once, it survives her deciding
she has nothing to say, and it is not muted by the rules that exist to stop her chattering.
