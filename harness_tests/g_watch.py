"""G-WATCH — "I will look out for a 3090 GPU to be available."  ...HOW?

She said that. She had no mechanism to look out for anything. It was a beautifully-formed
promise with nothing behind it — the SAME failure as a reminder that never fires, and the
worst kind this system produces: not a crash, not an error, but a thing he TRUSTED that
quietly was not true. He only caught it because he stopped and asked "how?".

Two honest fixes were available: stop her saying it, or MAKE IT TRUE.

    A reminder fires when the CLOCK says so.
    A watch fires when THE WORLD does.

THE THREE RULES, AND THEY ARE ALL THE SAME RULE — a watch that cannot be audited is a
prettier version of the lie it replaced:

  1. SHE MUST ACTUALLY LOOK.        `checked` counts real searches.
  2. SHE MUST SHOW WHAT SHE SAW.    no evidence -> it cannot fire.
  3. SHE MUST BE ABLE TO SAY NO.    and NO is the expected answer, nearly every time.
