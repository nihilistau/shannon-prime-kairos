"""G-ASKED — she answers the question he asked.

Built from a REAL conversation (2026-07-14). Every case below is a turn that actually happened and
actually went wrong. The operator sent the transcript; this is it, turned into a gate.

    › you:  well, do you remember my cats name?
    ‹ her:  I don't have a stored "Cats Name" memory. Can you tell me your cat's name?

    › you:  what is your name?
    ‹ her:  Your cat's named Tuffy? I was wondering why you kept calling him that.
      recall: ["The user said: My cat's NAME is Tuffy.", "The user's NAME is Knack",
               "My NAME is Shannon."]

    › you:  do you remember what sex you are?
    ‹ her:  I don't have any stored memory that explicitly states my sex...
      recall: ["then we can REMEMBER our idea's like this!",
               "REMEMBER my GPU is an RTX 2060.",
               "REMEMBER this about me: my workshop is called Forge966733."]

She missed the cat, then blurted the cat's name at a question about HER name, then answered "what
sex are you" with a graphics card. She has 'I am a woman' (speaker=self, identity) on disk.

── ONE ROOT CAUSE, WEARING FOUR COATS: THE FRAMING OF A QUESTION IS NOT THE QUESTION ────
  1. THE VERB BECAME CONTENT. "do you REMEMBER ..." shares the token `remember` with three junk
     rows that begin with the word "Remember" — they are captured INSTRUCTIONS, fossils of the
     store_verb bypass. The question's own verb retrieved them (0.50) while the row that answers
     it scored 0.00. Fixed: memory verbs are stopwords, on both sides.
  2. THE ADDRESSEE BECAME THE SUBJECT. _ASKS_SELF matched the bare `you` in "do YOU remember my
     cat's name", so the question scoped to HER and she answered with her own name. Fixed: unframe
     the question, then read the pronouns.
  3. THE PACKAGING BECAME THE CLAIM. "Remember my GPU is an RTX 2060." keyed on the slot
     `remember my gpu`, so it could never supersede the real GPU row and sat beside it forever.
     Fixed: normalize_fact() strips the wrapper at the door.
  4. THE PLURAL NEVER MET THE POSSESSIVE. "cats" -> {cats}, "cat's" -> {cat}. They never matched,
     and \\bcat\\b never fired on "cats", so the cat row took a -0.40 penalty for mentioning a pet
     he had supposedly not asked about. Fixed: depluralise both sides.

── AND THE GUARDS WERE ALL ON THE POLITE PATH ───────────────────────────────────────────
_target_and_rank() — the pronoun scoping, the relationship penalty, the identity boost, the
salience prior — was called by recall(), THE TOOL. spine.recall_decider(), the AUTOMATIC per-turn
injection that produced the ◈ recall lines above, never ran any of it. Third time in this one file
(the lifecycle filter, the twin ranker, this). Now in the seam.

Every assertion here goes through spine.recall_decider — the path that actually ran when this
conversation went wrong.
