"""G-TUNING — a knob that does not change behaviour is decoration.

The whole recurring failure of this system is capability that EXISTS but is not
REACHABLE: the supersede lane nothing wrote to, the personality pack never wired into a
toolset, the KAIROS kernel that was never compiled, the recall authority nobody could
see. A settings panel is the easiest possible place to repeat that mistake — sliders
that move and change nothing.

So this gate does not check that the UI renders. It checks that turning a knob CHANGES
WHAT SHE DOES:

  * the registry declares knobs with bounds, help, and PROVENANCE (measured vs chosen)
  * an unknown key is REFUSED (a typo must not become a dead setting)
  * values are CLAMPED to their declared bounds
  * an override PERSISTS, and reset restores the declared default
  * and the load-bearing one: moving kairos.max_chain / kairos.continue_margin
    actually changes the decision the scheduler makes on the very next turn.

Offline: no daemon, no model.
