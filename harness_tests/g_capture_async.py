"""G-CAPTURE-ASYNC — she does not wait on a GPU before she is allowed to answer him.

── THE BUG (measured, not theorised, 2026-07-14) ────────────────────────────────────────
remember() POSTed /v1/capture SYNCHRONOUSLY, timeout=120, on the write path of every fact. And
_capture_after_turn() calls remember() once per durable sentence, up to four, BEFORE the gateway
returns her reply (app.py:116, :128).

Timed against the live daemon, warm, nothing else running:

    527 ms  'My workshop bench is made of oak'
    403 ms  'Knack has an esp32 running the sensors'
    475 ms  'My NUC runs 24/7 in the cupboard'
    297 ms  'Knack is teaching himself the guitar'
    ------
   1702 ms  added to a ~4,400 ms turn, before he sees a single token of what she says.

That is the GOOD case. timeout=120 x 4 facts: THE WORST CASE IS EIGHT MINUTES OF SILENCE while she
waits for a GPU to finish building a cache. It is the judge-call bug again (#19-#22) — an aux model
call sitting inline on a path a human is waiting on — this time on the write path of every fact he
tells her.

── AND THE THING SHE WAS WAITING FOR IS NOT READ ON THIS PROFILE ────────────────────────
The mint builds ep.k/ep.v/ep.mf: KV blobs for the ENGINE's L5/replay recall. The live profile sets
authority='spine', and app.py:816 forces cfg.auto_recall=False on EVERY gateway turn — so the
engine recall, the only consumer of those episodes, never runs on a turn. In the harness, `npos` is
read by exactly two functions, memory_stats() and verify_registry(), and both are REPORTING.

She was being held silent to build an artifact the live recall path cannot read. The episodes still
matter for the daemon-direct fallback (gateway down), so they are not deleted — they are moved off
the path a human is waiting on, which is where they always belonged.

── WHAT THIS GATE ACTUALLY ASSERTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Not "the queue works". Two things that matter:
  1. THE ROW IS DURABLE THE INSTANT SHE IS TOLD. Deferring the mint must not defer the FACT.
     Every guard — admission, identity firewall, dedupe, supersede, secret classification — still
     runs synchronously, because those are what make it a memory rather than a log line.
  2. SHE IS NOT BLOCKED. A write completes in milliseconds even when the daemon is a black hole.
