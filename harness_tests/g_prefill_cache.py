"""G-PREFILL-CACHE — every turn must be a STRICT EXTENSION of the last one.

THE OPERATOR'S QUESTION: "why is it fast at first and painfully slow 6000 tokens later?"

The answer was not decay. Decode never changed — it sat at 11-21 tok/s from the first turn
to the last. What changed was the COST OF A CACHE MISS, and the misses were there all along:

    TURN-PHASE: prefill   903 ms                  <- an ordinary turn (cache hit)
    TURN-PHASE: prefill 1676 tok in 111531 ms     <- a kairos continuation
    TURN-PHASE: prefill 2628 tok in 188452 ms     <- the ordinary turn AFTER it

Two full prefills, every time she continued a cut-off thought. A miss costs O(conversation
length) — the same bug that costs 20 seconds at turn five costs six minutes at turn sixty.
Nothing degraded. The bill just grew.

THE CAUSE, in one argument: `agent_chat_stream(..., tools=[])`.

    tools is None -> the CACHED system prompt: persona + ~1.5k tokens of tool preamble.
                     Every ordinary turn uses this.
    tools == []   -> "no tools", which REBUILDS the system prompt without that preamble.

`[]` is not None. It reads like "offer her no tools this turn" and it means "hand the model
a different token 0" — and agent.py's own comment, three lines above where it did this,
already named the consequence: "a per-turn system-prompt rewrite diverges the persist-KV
cache at token 0". The kairos continuation and the repeat-guard reroll both passed `[]`.
They also left the RESIDENT cache holding the no-tools prefix, so the next ordinary turn
diverged from that and re-prefilled as well.

This gate is a lint, deliberately. The live symptom takes a long conversation and several
minutes to reproduce, which is exactly the kind of bug that survives — it is invisible
until the machine is already unusable. The seam is one keystroke wide and it is cheap to
watch.
