"""G-DURABILITY + G-IDENTITY-FIREWALL — the two bugs that were eating her, gated on the
REAL rows they produced.

Both were found in the live registry on 2026-07-12, from one real conversation.

── 1. THE FIREHOSE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The daemon stored `raw_user` — the WHOLE user turn — as one episode whenever it passed a
word count and mentioned a person. Every conversational sentence mentions a person. So a
17-turn chat put 17 rows into long-term memory, including "yes, we lose lips, sink ships."
and "you are cool af! I really like you!", while the genuine facts (the esp32 sensors, the
2060 and the NUC, the PCs running 24/7) sat buried inside turns that were mostly banter.

The admission gate asked "is this about a person?" — a question about FORM. The right
question is "will this still be true tomorrow?" — DURABILITY. And a TURN IS NOT A FACT:
"oh i always run my pc's 24/7. so you are lucky there" holds one fact and one piece of
banter, so it must be SPLIT, not kept or dropped whole.

Every DROP line below is a row that is really in the registry. Every KEEP line is a fact
that must survive the new rules — including the ones that were riding inside a chatty turn.

── 2. THE IDENTITY FIREWALL ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A gate asked her "what is your name?". She answered "My name is Shannon." — correctly —
and stored it through remember(), which is the USER store. Stamped speaker=user, classed
identity, it superseded all three rows saying the user is Knack. The store came out of it
asserting that KNACK IS CALLED SHANNON. Her name had eaten his.

The store she writes to is the only signal for whose fact it is, and she picked the wrong
door. A prompt cannot be the guard when the price of one slip is the user's identity.
