"""G-KAIROS-POLICY — she must not talk forever, and she must not talk every turn.

The operator's requirement, verbatim: "it has to make sense tho, you cant just let it
talk forever. or talk everyturn etc."

So the policy is gated BEFORE it is ever wired to a GPU. Silence is the default; speech
is earned. These are the bounds, and they are asserted, not asserted-about:

  1. an ORDINARY finished turn -> SILENT          (calibrated: margin +2 >> -13.75)
  2. a turn cut off mid-thought -> CONTINUE       (margin -15 < -13.75)
  3. she asked HIM a question   -> SILENT         (she waits; she does not answer herself)
  4. she cannot chain           -> one unprompted turn, then she MUST wait for him
  5. cooldown holds
  6. hourly cap holds
  7. his turn RESETS her budget (that is what makes it a conversation)
  8. a continuation that says nothing new is DROPPED, not shown

Pure: no daemon, no model, no clock. Injected `now` and a seeded rng.
