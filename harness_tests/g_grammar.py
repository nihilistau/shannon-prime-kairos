"""G-GRAMMAR — the tool grammar, tested against every failure this codebase has ACTUALLY had.

Nothing in here is invented. Every case below is a thing the model really did, that the old
parser really tried to survive by healing, re-prompting or giving up:

    _NAME_SPLIT_RE       'get _time()'  -> healed with a regex
    ```python / ```py    accepted, because the reason-SFT model drifts between fences
    MALFORMED RECOVERY   re-prompt: "[parse error] That call could not be parsed"
    calls[:1]            three calls in one fence: add_note, edit_note, remove_note — she
                         created a note, tidied it, deleted it, all without ever seeing a
                         result, then told him it was done
    "(tool loop exhausted)"   what he actually saw on screen

Four layers of hoping, and every one of them exists for the same reason: the model emits
free text, and free text can be wrong. The grammar's job is to make the wrong ones NOT EXIST
— and, where it cannot yet (until the engine masks), to refuse in a way that TEACHES rather
than one that just says "no".
