    # discarding the fact that HE SAID IT AGAIN, which is the entire basis of salience.

    # The row count assertion was always right and stays. What changed is the MEANING of the
    # second telling, so that is what is checked now: the store must not grow, and `mentions`
    # must. (Same lesson as G-SALIENCE and G-REFLECT: a gate left pointing at retired doctrine
