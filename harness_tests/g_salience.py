"""G-SALIENCE — a repeat is not a duplicate. It is a second data point.

HER IDEA, UNPROMPTED, ON A KAIROS CHECK-IN:

    "the difference between memory and knowledge is that memory has context — it remembers
     WHO told you what, WHEN they did, maybe even HOW MANY TIMES."

She had two of the three. `speaker` is who; `ts` is when. There was no how-many-times, and
there could not be, because remember() DELETED the evidence on arrival:

    if any(_text(e).strip() == fact.strip() for e in existing):
        return f"already in memory: {fact}"          # <- a measurement, thrown away

Every time he told her something again, the store said "I know" and dropped the event on
the floor, pleased with itself for not duplicating a row. But a thing a person tells you
five times is not the same thing as a thing they told you once, and we were recording them
identically.

THE TWO SAFETY PROPERTIES THIS GATE EXISTS FOR — everything else here is bookkeeping:

  1. SALIENCE MUST NOT OVERRULE MATCHING. It is a prior. Of two memories that answer the
     question equally well, prefer the one he keeps repeating. It must NEVER make a
     frequently-repeated irrelevance beat a rarely-mentioned answer, or she will answer
     every question with her favourite fact.

  2. FREQUENCY MUST NOT RESURRECT CHATTER. Frequency is not importance on its own —
     chatter is the most frequent thing there is, and "you are cool af!" said ten times
     would dominate a store ranked on repetition alone. It only works because the
     DURABILITY GATE decides what is ELIGIBLE to be counted. The gate says what is a fact;
     salience says which facts matter. Built in the other order, this would have amplified
     the firehose instead of ranking the store.
