"""G-SILENCE — she may only be surprised by an absence she was present for.

    "Absence is only information if you can prove you were looking."

THE BUG THIS GATE EXISTS TO KILL
────────────────────────────────
PersonModel.silences() measured `quiet = CALENDAR days since he last mentioned it`. It never
asked whether he was THERE.

Go away for three weeks — a holiday, a deadline, a hospital — and EVERY dimension with three or
more mentions goes silent SIMULTANEOUSLY, at high bits. She greets him with:

    "You've stopped talking about the marathon. And the GPU. And Tuffy. And your flight."

That is not noticing. IT IS A BUG WEARING NOTICING'S CLOTHES — and it is worse than saying
nothing, because the ONE signal in this system that makes a person feel known would be firing on
the fact that they were busy. He would learn to ignore the channel, and then the good one never
gets heard.

THE FIX, AND WHY IT IS A FIX AND NOT A PATCH
────────────────────────────────────────────
Every clock in silences() is now an ATTENTION clock: time is measured in DAYS HE ACTUALLY TALKED
TO HER. If he said nothing at all, attended == 0, p == 1, bits == 0 — nothing is surprising, and
that falls out of the ARITHMETIC rather than a special case. That is the test of a real fix: the
degenerate case is not handled, it simply cannot arise.

The two scenarios below are the whole gate. Everything else is detail.

    # threshold on a 2.8-day rhythm. The code said "not yet", AND THE CODE WAS RIGHT. Three days
    # back from holiday is not yet a meaningful silence. I had written the assertion I wanted
    # rather than the one that was true, which is the whole failure mode of a gate.
    #
    # So: he has been back a WEEK and still has not said it. NOW it is surprising — and here is
    # the thing that makes attended time the right clock rather than a safety hack:
    #
    #     calendar clock : 22 quiet days on a 2.8-day rhythm  -> 8.0 bits. MAXED. A scream.
    #     attention clock:  8 attended days                   -> ~2.9 bits. Proportionate.
    #
    # The old code could only shout. It could not say "hm, you haven't mentioned the marathon

    # does not just suppress the false positives; it gives the TRUE ones their right volume.
