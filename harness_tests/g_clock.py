"""G-CLOCK — every timestamp in this system must survive its own round trip.

THIS GATE EXISTS BECAUSE I FIXED THE SAME BUG TWICE, EIGHT HOURS APART, IN TWO FILES.

    watch.py    (2026-07-13, morning)   check() wrote gmtime; due_checks() read mktime.
                                        Every watch was 10 hours overdue the moment it ran.
                                        She searched for his RTX 3090 forty-six times.

    lifecycle.py (2026-07-14, night)    _age_days() — THE one age function in the memory
                                        system — did exactly the same thing. Every fact was
                                        0.42 days old the instant it was written. Salience
                                        decayed on it. Silence accrued on it.

I found the first, fixed it, wrote a commit about it, AND NEVER GREPPED FOR THE PATTERN.
There is a phrase for that in this codebase, from an earlier commit of mine about the identity
firewall: "I FIXED THE INSTANCE AND CALLED IT THE CLASS." So here is the class.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE RULE

    time.mktime   is the inverse of  time.localtime
    calendar.timegm is the inverse of  time.gmtime

Every stamp in this tree is WRITTEN with time.gmtime() and a literal 'Z'. Anything that reads
one back with mktime() is telling a lie exactly the size of the local UTC offset. That lie is:

    ZERO in London.       5 hours in New York.       10 HOURS where the operator lives.

Which is why it cannot be caught by a normal test: IT IS CORRECT ON THE MAINTAINER'S LAPTOP.
It needs a ROUND TRIP — write it the way the store writes it, read it the way the store reads
it, and demand they agree — under a forced non-zero timezone.
