"""G-REFLECT — she thinks about him when the room is quiet. She rarely mentions it.

THINKING IS NOT SPEAKING, and this gate exists to keep them apart.

She reflects silently on an idle clock: reads what she knows about him, writes down what she
has come to believe. That happens whether or not he ever hears about it — it is how the model
of him gets built, and MOST of what she concludes should simply become part of what she knows,
unremarked. A person who told you every single thing they had ever noticed about you would be
unbearable to live with.

Only a genuinely SURPRISING conclusion earns an interruption. The bar is not "did she think of
something" — she thinks on a clock; she will always have thought of something. The bar is
whether the model itself did not see it coming, measured in bits, which is the one property of
a conclusion that cannot be faked.

    An unprompted "I've been thinking about you" that lands on something obvious is worse than
    silence: it teaches him to ignore the channel, and then the good one never gets heard.

# ── A GATE THAT NEEDS A LIVE DAEMON IS NOT A GATE (2026-07-14) ──────────────────────────
# remember() makes a SYNCHRONOUS call to the daemon's /v1/capture to mint the episode —
# `urlopen(..., timeout=120)` — on EVERY memory write. With the daemon up, this gate hung: the
# episode mint is a model forward and it grinds. With the daemon down it degrades gracefully
# (the fact is still recorded), which is the behaviour the gate actually wants to test.
#
# So point it at a closed port. Connection-refused fails in microseconds; a LIVE daemon fails in
# up to two minutes, per write. A test whose runtime depends on whether a GPU service happens to
# be running is a test that will be quietly disabled the first week it annoys someone.
#
# (The 120s inline capture on the memory-write hot path is a real finding and has its own task.
# It is not this gate's job to work around it — it is this gate's job not to DEPEND on it.)
