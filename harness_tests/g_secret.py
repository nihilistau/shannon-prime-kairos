"""G-SECRET — the privacy decline must be REACHABLE, not merely implemented.

── THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE (2026-07-14) ──────────────────────────────────
spine.recall_decider() protects secrets by checking `mem_class == "private-secret"`, and
memory.py calls the result "confabulation/leak impossible by construction".

lifecycle.classify() — the only classifier the authoritative writer runs — could emit exactly:

    relationship | identity | event | preference | fact

`private-secret` was not among them. THE CONSUMER WAS CHECKING FOR A VALUE THE PRODUCER COULD NOT
PRODUCE. Live registry, 86 rows: zero private-secret. The decline had never fired once, and could
not. Every secret he ever told her was stored as an ordinary `fact` and delivered as ordinary
context.

The class was only ever minted by the DAEMON (recall.rs::classify_mem_class, armed by growth=true).
The "ONE MEMORY AUTHORITY" fix moved writes to the harness and set growth=false — and took the only
producer with it. THE PRIVACY GUARANTEE WAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF A CORRECTNESS FIX.

── AND WHY THE EXISTING GATE WAS GREEN THROUGH ALL OF IT ────────────────────────────────
g_mempolicy_v3_offline.py:34,37 does this:

    {"name": "sec1", "mem_class": "private-secret", ...}     <- it BUILDS the row itself

...and then asserts the dispatch honours it. IT TESTS THE DISPATCH. It never asks whether anything
in the system can PRODUCE the class. It was green for weeks certifying a guarantee that did not
exist. Same sin as G-REFLECT setting _LAST_EVIDENCE by hand.

    A GATE THAT SUPPLIES ITS OWN PRECONDITION PROVES ONLY THAT THE GUARD COMPILES.

So this gate NEVER writes mem_class. It says a sentence to remember() and follows the consequences
all the way to the words the model would have seen. §4 is the generalisation and the point of the
whole file: every class the decider branches on MUST be producible by the writer.
