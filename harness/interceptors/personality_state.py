"""PF-B3 pipeline stage — persist the model's self-emitted personality tags.

Post-call (priority 72, before the ResponseShaper at 80): reads [MOOD]/[VOICE]/[TRAIT] off the
reply, persists them into the persona state (PF-B2 write_state), and strips them from the reply.
The model self-modifies its own mood/voice/traits, and the change survives to the next turn.
Registered only when SP_PERSONALITY=1 (writes persona.md, so opt-in).
