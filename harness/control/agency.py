"""The agency loop -- the model maintains its own memory autonomously.

Composes ephemeral tool calling (``harness.mcp.tools``) + the memory tools
(``harness.skills.memory``) into a maintenance ROUND: the model is shown its
current memory and the curation tools and decides FOR ITSELF whether to forget
redundant/stale facts or consolidate them. Run between turns or on a schedule --
the "auto round" where the organism *does things* with its memory instead of only
stopping. This is the harness-side realization of the KAIROS agency tick; the Rust
heartbeat (engine ``kairos.rs``) can call ``agency_round`` on a tick to make it
fully autonomous.
