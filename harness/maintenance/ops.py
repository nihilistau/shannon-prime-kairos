"""OPERATOR MAINTENANCE — the buttons, and the real work behind them.

The operator asked for: change moods and save; click to add/remove memory entries;
perform compaction, cleanup, nightshift.

Every one of these does REAL work and returns a RECEIPT (what changed, and how much). A
maintenance button that reports "done!" and cannot tell you what it did is how a system
rots quietly — and this store has already rotted once (487 rows, 375 of them ASR test
corpus, recalled mid-answer as fact).

Nothing here deletes. Cleanup QUARANTINES (restorable). Compaction TOMBSTONES (superseded,
kept for provenance). The only destructive verb is forget(), and that is the operator's
explicit choice, one row at a time.

    """REFLECTION — she looks back at what she has learned and draws conclusions from it.

    ── THE RENAME (2026-07-13, the operator's call) ──────────────────────────────
    This used to be called nightshift(), and so is the daemon's auto-finetuning curator
    (routes.rs alone says "nightshift" 78 times; there is a whole nightshift_curator.rs).
    Two different things wearing one name is how you end up debugging the wrong one.

    THE DAEMON KEEPS THE NAME. It earns it: it is the offline pass that consolidates memory
    into weights while nothing else is happening — which is what sleep is for, and what
    "nightshift" means.

    THIS one runs in the middle of a conversation, on demand, in seconds. It is not sleep.
    It is what you do when you sit back for a moment and realise something about the person
    you have been talking to. The literature already has the word — Generative Agents calls
    exactly this pass REFLECTION — so it is reflect().

    ── WHAT IT DOES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      1. compact   — no point drawing conclusions from a store full of duplicates
      2. traits    — the personality curator, so who she IS drifts on evidence
      3. insight   — NEW: she reads what she knows about him and writes down what she has
                     come to BELIEVE, which is not the same as what she was TOLD

    Step 3 is the one that matters, and it is the piece the literature says we were missing:
    a memory system that only stores what it is told can never know anything its owner did
    not say out loud. Reflection is where "he mentioned fun, and music, and playing with the
    kettle" becomes "he values play for its own sake" — a thing he never said, and the
    truest thing in the store."""

    A store that only holds what it was TOLD can never know anything its owner did not say
    out loud. He never said "I value play for its own sake" — he said he likes fun, and that
    the kettle is his favourite, and that music in the evening is good. The conclusion is
    the truest thing in the store and nobody has ever written it down, because nothing in
    the system was ever asked to THINK about the facts, only to keep them.

    This is Generative Agents' reflection step, and it is the missing term the 2026
    multi-factor work is pointing at when it says the value of a memory cannot be judged at
    write time from the sentence alone.

    ── THE ONE RULE, AND IT IS THE RULE THIS SYSTEM KEEPS LEARNING ──────────────
    AN INFERENCE IS NOT A TESTIMONY, AND IT MUST NEVER READ LIKE ONE.

    An insight is HER conclusion, not HIS statement. If it goes into the store looking like
    something he said, then the next time she recalls it she will tell him HE said it — and
    this store has already lost his name and then his gender to exactly that confusion, both
    times because the owner of a sentence got blurred. So every insight is stamped
    src=reflection, and lifecycle.render() frames it as "I've come to think: ..." — never
    "Knack told me: ...". She may be wrong about him. She may not be wrong about him in HIS
    VOICE.

    Reinforcement does something quietly lovely here: an insight she arrives at AGAIN, on a
    later reflection, does not duplicate — it reinforces, and its mentions climb. A belief
    she keeps re-deriving from independent evidence gets stronger on its own. That is not a
    trick; that is what a conviction IS.
