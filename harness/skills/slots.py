"""slots — Phase C of docs/INVARIANT-MEMORY.md: topic-equivalence as a relation the
table can consume, ORACLE-PROPOSED, never oracle-ruled.

THE FINDING THIS CLOSES (verdict-table notes, the "ladders" case): the prose topic test
(topic_of overlap >= 2) misses paraphrase-distance competition — his "wary of ladders
after a fall" shares ONE content word with her "relaxed about ladders these days", so
his testimony does not cover it and she can lawfully say it over him. The fix is NOT a
cleverer string metric — that is the clever-fragile thing this codebase is punished for
every time — it is the quarantine architecture working as designed:

    THE ORACLE (the served model, /v1/oneshot, greedy, scratch cache) PROPOSES
    same-subject links between two rows. The links live HERE, in a derived append-only
    sidecar. verdict.competition() consumes them as one more way an inference can be
    COVERED. The table rules exactly as before — competition=1 cells already rule
    not-spoken — the RELATION feeding the coordinate just grew eyes.

WHY A FALLIBLE ORACLE IS ADMISSIBLE HERE (the PRA entry bar, INVARIANT-MEMORY.md §1.3):
the failure asymmetry points the right way. A WRONG link silences an inference — costs
her a sentence. A MISSING link is exactly today's behaviour. The oracle can only ever
push toward silence on subjects he may have spoken to; it structurally cannot make her
speak over him, cannot admit, cannot retire, cannot write the registry. Every proposal
is a finite witness (both addrs, the verdict, the oracle tag, a timestamp) in a file.

SIDECAR RULES (the semindex discipline, same reasons):
  - append-only; verdicts are cached, "different" too (never re-ask the same pair);
  - keyed by content addr (semindex.addr_of — ONE address vocabulary);
  - tombstone-blind: liveness is the registry's, joined at read by the evaluator;
  - never blocks, never raises out; a dead daemon means no NEW proposals, nothing else.

Proposer scan policy (v1, deliberate): candidate pairs are (non-ground-truth row,
same-speaker LIVE ground-truth row) with prose overlap EXACTLY 1 — the gap zone. Pairs
at >= 2 are already covered by prose; pairs at 0 are unbounded and unpriced (a later
phase can widen with a budget). Run: python -m harness.skills.slots --scan  (LIVE).

# ── the ORDER-FRAME proposer (OFFLINE; proposals only) — Phase C2 ─────────────────────
# The operator's insight, made mechanical: similarity (magnitudes of meaning) failed as
# a link detector twice — cosine (no discrimination) and the greedy LLM judge (no
# yield). Its OPPOSITE is pair-level STRUCTURE, and structure is literally in the
# invariant-maximality program as EMULATION: two rows link the way a known pair links
# iff the PAIRS are order-equivalent. The ladders pair is an emulation of the water
# pair: same stative frame, same grammatical subject, shared subject-matter inside the
# value region, competing residues on both sides.
#
# THE SCAR THIS RESPECTS: find_contradicted() was deleted from lifecycle.py for being a
# semantic contradiction engine built from substring matching — A VERDICT-WRITER. This
# is the same instrument with the OPPOSITE authority: it PROPOSES into the quarantined
# sidecar, where a wrong link costs one sentence (an inference wrongly silenced while
# its fake-cover is live) and a missing link is yesterday's behaviour. The incumbent
# topic test (testimony_wins, overlap >= 2) accepts exactly the same false-positive
# direction on purpose ("at worst she is quieter") — so the ship bar, measured by
# sem_pair_score.py on the committed pair corpus, is THE INCUMBENT'S OWN STANDARD:
# precision no worse than prose-overlap's, recall strictly better on the gap zone.
