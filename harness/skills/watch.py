"""THE WATCH — she said she would keep an eye out. Now she can.

    her: "I will look out for a 3090 GPU to be available."
    him: "...how?"

She could not. There was no mechanism to look out for anything, and she said it anyway — a
beautifully-formed promise with nothing behind it. This is the SAME failure as a reminder
that never fires, and it is the worst kind this system produces: not a crash, not an error,
but a thing he TRUSTED that quietly was not true. He only found it because he stopped and
asked "how?". Most such promises are never audited at all; they simply rot.

Two honest fixes were on the table: STOP HER SAYING IT, or MAKE IT TRUE.

    A reminder fires when the CLOCK says so.
    A watch fires when THE WORLD does.

Everything else already existed — the board, the tick, the raise-it-like-a-reminder path.
The only missing piece was a note whose trigger is a QUESTION instead of a TIME.

── THE THREE RULES, AND THEY ARE ALL THE SAME RULE ──────────────────────────────

1. SHE MUST ACTUALLY LOOK. `checked` counts the times she really searched. It is the receipt
   that turns "I'll keep an eye out" from a pleasantry into a claim he can audit — and if
   she has looked eleven times and found nothing, that is worth knowing too.

2. SHE MUST SHOW WHAT SHE SAW. A watch cannot fire without EVIDENCE: a title, a snippet, a
   URL he can click. A watch that can fire on nothing is a watch that has learned to
   hallucinate, and it would be worse than no watch at all, because he would believe it.

3. SHE MUST BE ABLE TO SAY NO. The judgement is a strict YES/NO with a quotation, and NO is
   the expected answer nearly every time. A model asked "did this fire?" and rewarded for
   enthusiasm will fire on the first plausible-looking snippet it sees.
