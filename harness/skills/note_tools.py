"""THE NOTE TOOLS — the board, in her hands.

These are written to be CALLED BY A 12B, which means three constraints shaped them, and all
three were paid for elsewhere in this system:

  1. A TOOL WITH NO DOCSTRING IS A TOOL SHE GUESSES AT. The personality tools shipped with
     their help in the decorator while the schema was built from __doc__, so she saw empty
     descriptions, invented `adjust_mood(new="calm")`, and blew the tool loop on a
     TypeError. Every argument here is named, typed in prose, and shown in an example.

  2. A TOOL THAT IS NOT IN THE LIVE SET DOES NOT EXIST. recall() sat in MEMORY_TOOLS_EXTRA
     for weeks — correct, gated, wired into nothing — so she answered "what is my name?"
     from her persona instead of looking it up. These join default_tools().

  3. FEW TOOLS, OR SHE PICKS BADLY. agent.py's own comment: "a 12B picks reliably and fast
     from ~6 tools; 14 overwhelms it (it explores and stalls)". So this is FIVE verbs, not
     the eight the feature naturally wants. `add_note` absorbs "remind me" (a note with a
     due date IS a reminder); `find_notes` with no query absorbs "list them all".

AND `due` TAKES ENGLISH. Asking a 12B to emit "2026-07-17T09:00:00Z" is asking for a
malformed timestamp and a silent no-op reminder. It says "friday", "tomorrow 9am", "in 2
hours" — the words he used — and the PARSER does the arithmetic, where arithmetic belongs.
