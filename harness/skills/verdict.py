"""verdict — Phase B of docs/INVARIANT-MEMORY.md: THE evaluator. Rules are DATA.

The committed verdict table (harness_tests/fixtures/sem/verdict-table.json, frozen by
sem_enum.py --freeze, pinned by G-SEM-TABLE) is the law. This module is the ONE
implementation of the signature: it computes a row's CELL from the system's OPERATIONAL
relations and looks the ruling up. The enumerator imports THESE functions — if a second
copy of sigma() ever exists, it will drift, and that is the two-paths bug with a
mathematician's hat on.

NORMALIZATION LAW (read off the running code, not invented):
    status   missing -> observed     (lifecycle.testimony_wins: `or STATUS_OBSERVED` —
                                      77 of her 81 live rows predate the status field)
    speaker  missing -> user         (same seam, same default)
    mem_class missing -> fact        (lifecycle.salience's default)

THE EVALUATOR NEVER GUESSES. A cell absent from the table returns None (UNMAPPED) and
shadow mode COUNTS it — it does not invent a ruling. An unmapped cell reaching the
counter is Phase A's completeness failing in the field, which is exactly the news you
want loudly.

SHADOW MODE (SP_SEM_LAW=1, mapped in serve.py): the seam calls shadow() on its FINAL
result set. One direction is checked, and it is the load-bearing one:

    EVERYTHING ADMITTED MUST BE TABLE-ADMISSIBLE.

(The other direction — something the table would admit that the seam did not — is not
checkable here: absence may lawfully be the lexical match-gate, and the match-gate is
admission-by-MATCH, not policy.) Divergences and unmapped cells are counters plus
optional witness lines (SP_SEM_LAW_LOG). Shadow NEVER raises, NEVER alters results,
NEVER blocks speech. Cutover (the seam consulting ruling() as its filter) is Phase B2,
and its precondition is a zero-divergence receipt from this shadow.
