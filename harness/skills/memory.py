"""Memory tools — the model's explicit handle on its own long-term memory.

These operate on the daemon's persistent episode registry (``SP_RECALL_REGISTRY``),
the same content-addressed store the autonomous recall path reads. Exposed as
ephemeral tools (``ToolSpec.from_callable``) so the served model can *deliberately*
introspect, store, and forget facts — unifying the memory system with tool calling.
The autonomous memory-agency (forget/decide/merge in the daemon) keeps running; these
give the model a first-person lever on the same store.

Each function is a plain callable with a typed signature, so
``ToolSpec.from_callable`` derives the tool schema automatically.

    ── THE SUPERSEDE MACHINERY WAS BYPASSED ON THE MAIN TURN PATH (2026-07-14) ────────────
    This function iterated _load() — EVERY row, tombstones included — and left the lifecycle
    filter to whoever called it. Two callers. ONE of them remembered:

        memory.recall()        [e for e in ... if not e.get("lifecycle")]     <- filtered
        spine.recall_decider() hits = search_memories_ranked_rows(...)        <- DID NOT

    recall_decider is the AUTOMATIC recall — the context injection that runs on EVERY TURN,
    without her choosing it. PROVEN, on the real code path:

        THE STORE:                     TOMBSTONE 'My GPU is an RTX 2060'
                                       LIVE      'My GPU is an RTX 3090'

        the recall() TOOL:             1. Knack told me: My GPU is an RTX 3090     correct
        INJECTED EVERY TURN:           -> My GPU is an RTX 2060      THE DEAD ONE, AND FIRST
                                       -> My GPU is an RTX 3090

    He tells her he upgraded his card. Supersede fires perfectly, writes the tombstone — and then
    every turn for the rest of her life the automatic recall hands her the corpse ANYWAY, ranked
    ABOVE the truth, and she has no way to know one of them is dead.

    So the entire lifecycle system — supersede, the identity firewall, all of MEM-OKF v2, every
    correction he has ever made — was live ONLY when she happened to call the recall() TOOL. On
    the path that actually feeds her context, it never ran at all.

    THE BUG IS NOT THE MISSING FILTER. It is that an invariant every reader must hold was written
    in a CALLER instead of in the SEAM they share — the same shape as on_user_turn armed on one
    path of two, and the shear guard testing a proxy. A rule enforced in one of two paths is
    enforced in NEITHER, because the unguarded path is the one that runs.

    It lives here now. A caller can no longer forget it; it must ASK for the dead
    (include_retired=True), which is a thing only the audit lane has any business doing.

    ── AND TESTIMONY OUTRANKS INFERENCE, IN THE SAME SEAM ─────────────────────────────────
    An inference is not a memory of something that happened; it is a conclusion she drew. She is
    allowed to be wrong about him. SHE IS NOT ALLOWED TO SAY IT OVER HIM. If she has concluded
    something about a topic HIS OWN WORDS already cover, his words go and her guess stays home:

        observed  'Knack is terrified of open water'   <- he told her
        inferred  'Knack is comfortable in open water' <- she decided otherwise

    Surfacing both is not scrupulous, it is deaf: she would say "you told me you're terrified" and
    "I've come to think you're comfortable" in one breath. This is a SPEECH rule, not a storage
    rule — nothing is destroyed, the inference stays on disk and stays auditable. It simply does
    not get to take the floor on a subject he has already spoken to.

    It is deliberately a TOPIC test and not a contradiction test, because I cannot detect semantic
    contradiction with string operations and a verdict I cannot defend is a lie with a timestamp.
    A topic test fails SAFE in the only direction that matters: at worst she is quieter than she
    needed to be. It can never delete a fact and never assert something false.

    Hours after committing the fix for search_memories_ranked_rows — with a commit message
    explaining at length that AN INVARIANT ENFORCED IN ONE OF TWO PATHS IS ENFORCED IN NEITHER —
    the sweep for OTHER instances of that class found this function, DIRECTLY BELOW IT, doing the

    then fixed the instance in front of me and stopped looking. THAT is the actual bug, and it is

    THE FIX IS NOT A THIRD COPY OF THE FILTER. A rule you have to remember is a rule you will

# name?", she called recall(query="What is my name?") — the identical string. Two opposite
# questions, one query. So the pronoun in the string SHE passes carries no information
# about who is being asked after; it only tells you whose mouth the paraphrase is in.
#
# The pronoun is only reliable where it was UTTERED. In HIS sentence "my" means Knack and
# "your" means Shannon, always. So ownership is resolved from the human's words, and her
# query is used for what it is actually good for: matching the content.
