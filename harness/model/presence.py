"""THE ATTENTION LEDGER — proof that she was looking.

    "Absence is only information if you can prove you were looking."

The neighbour tells you something by NOT being there only if you were at the window at 5am. If
you slept in, the empty driveway carries zero bits. The information is not in the absence — it
is in the CONJUNCTION of a live expectation and a proven observation that came back empty.

── THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO KILL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PersonModel.silences() measured `quiet = days since he last MENTIONED a thing`. It never asked
whether he was THERE.

So: go away for three weeks — a holiday, a deadline, a hospital — and EVERY dimension with three
or more mentions goes silent SIMULTANEOUSLY, at high bits. She greets you with:

    "You've stopped talking about the marathon. And the GPU. And Tuffy. And your flight."

That is not noticing. THAT IS A BUG WEARING NOTICING'S CLOTHES, and it is worse than saying
nothing, because the one signal in this system that makes a person feel KNOWN would be firing on
the fact that they were busy.

── THE FIX: MEASURE TIME IN DAYS HE WAS ACTUALLY HERE ─────────────────────────────────
Calendar time is irrelevant to silence. ATTENTION TIME is the only clock that can make an
absence mean anything.

    quiet_days   = calendar days since he last mentioned it        <- WRONG
    attended_days = days he TALKED TO HER and STILL did not mention it   <- the real quantity

If he said nothing at all across the window, attended == 0, and NOTHING is surprising. Absence of
data is not data. That falls out of the arithmetic for free rather than needing a special case,
which is how you know it is the right quantity.

── WHY A DAILY BUCKET AND NOT AN EVENT LOG ────────────────────────────────────────────
Cadence in this system is measured in DAYS ("he brings it up every two days"). A per-turn log
would be a bigger, slower, more privacy-laden thing that answers a question nobody asked. One
integer per day answers the only question silence needs:

    "Was the channel open on this day, yes or no?"

The file is append-safe, human-readable, and small enough to never need pruning: one line per
day he spoke to her at all.
