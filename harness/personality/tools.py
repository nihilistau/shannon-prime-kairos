"""PF-B4 — @personality decorators: model-CALLABLE self-modify tools.

PF-B3 lets the model self-modify via inline tags (a shortcut). PF-B4 makes it a first-class,
DURABLE action: `@personality`-decorated tools the model INVOKES through the existing @skill +
run_with_tools loop (same registry, same tool_code protocol) to change its own mood/voice/traits
or record a self-fact. `@personality` is just `@skill(pack="personality")`, so the advertise +
parse + dispatch machinery is 100% reused (anti-rebuild).

ADR-002: the tool call is the clean symbolic DECISION; the tool body (write_state / remember_self)
is the EXECUTOR. Advertise the "personality" pack in run_with_tools to give the model the controls.
