"""THE LADDER — escalation with gates, ported from Neon-City-Penthouse (IntimacyGates.js).

The operator's ask: R-rated roleplay, any theme, "use the python system and harness to
create structure and stay on track".

STRUCTURE IS THE FEATURE. A 12B told "you may be explicit" will either refuse, or lurch
straight to explicit on turn two and stay there — both of which kill the scene. The
Neon-City design solved this with a LADDER: intimacy has levels, each level has a GATE,
and a gate only opens when the fiction has earned it. That is what makes a scene feel
like a scene instead of a switch.

    1 light_touch    a hand, a shoulder, proximity
    2 kiss
    3 caress
    4 striptease
    5 intimate
    6 explicit
    7 depraved

RULES THAT MAKE IT WORK (all enforced in code, not in the prompt — a prompt is advice):
  * NO SKIPPING. Heat rises one rung at a time. You cannot go from 1 to 5 because the
    model got excited; the engine will not compose a prompt that allows it.
  * BEATS BEFORE RUNGS. Each rung needs a minimum number of exchanges at the current
    level before the next unlocks. Pacing is the whole craft.
  * THE OPERATOR HOLDS THE CAP. roleplay.max_heat in the tuning UI is a hard ceiling.
    Set it to 2 and the scene simply never goes past a kiss, no matter what anyone types.
  * DOWN IS ALWAYS FREE. Cooling off, stopping, or changing direction needs no gate and
    never fails. Escalation is gated; de-escalation is not.
  * A HARD STOP IS A HARD STOP. "stop", "wait", "no", "out of character" -> the scene
    breaks IMMEDIATELY, at any level, and she answers as herself.

This is fiction between consenting adults on the operator's own machine, and the point of
the gates is not squeamishness — it is that a story with no build has no heat in it.
