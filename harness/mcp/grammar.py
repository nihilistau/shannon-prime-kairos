"""THE TOOL GRAMMAR — one formal object, used to VALIDATE now and to MASK later.

WHAT TOOL CALLING IS TODAY, honestly:

    _TOOLCODE_RE          four accepted fence spellings (tool_code / python / py / tool)
    _NAME_SPLIT_RE        a regex that HEALS the model's typos: 'get _time()' -> 'get_time()'
    _calls_from_code      AST-parse and hope
    MALFORMED RECOVERY    re-prompt with "[parse error] That call could not be parsed"
    "(tool loop exhausted)"   what he actually saw on screen

Four layers of hoping, and a fifth (truncating three-calls-in-a-fence down to one) added by
me two days ago after she created a note, edited it and deleted it before ever seeing a
result. Every one of those exists FOR THE SAME REASON: the model emits free text, and free
text can be wrong.

── WHY A GRAMMAR, AND WHY IN PYTHON FIRST ───────────────────────────────────────
The engine can already mask logits — routes.rs masks specials to -inf on both the sampled
and the greedy path. A constrained decoder is an extension of machinery that exists, not a
new subsystem. But a mask needs something to enforce, AND WE DO NOT HAVE A GRAMMAR. We have
a regex and a prayer.

So: build the grammar once, HERE, where it can be tested without CUDA in the loop. It
validates today (deleting the healers) and it is the exact object routes.rs will mask
against tomorrow. Moving it down becomes "enforce this", not "invent one in Rust".

── WHAT DOMINO SAYS, AND WHY IT CHANGES THE DESIGN ──────────────────────────────
(Beurer-Kellner, Fischer, Vechev — "Guiding LLMs The Right Way", arXiv 2403.06988)

  1. NAIVE CONSTRAINED DECODING MAKES THE MODEL WORSE. Not slower — WORSE. Grammar
     terminals do not align with the model's subword vocabulary, so a mask built over
     CHARACTERS forces it off its natural token boundaries and task accuracy drops. That is
     the operator's exact worry ("don't restrict the model's ability to seem alive"), and it
     is measured rather than felt.

     The fix is SUBWORD ALIGNMENT: the legal-continuation set must be built over the MODEL'S
     OWN TOKENISATION of each terminal, not over its letters. Hence allowed_next() returns
     candidate STRINGS that a caller tokenises with the model's tokeniser — never a
     character class.

  2. IT CAN BE FASTER, NOT SLOWER. Where the grammar admits exactly ONE continuation, that
     token needs no forward pass — it is forced. After `recall(` there is exactly one legal
     next thing; after `remember(fact=` likewise. DOMINO gets ~2x in places by emitting
     these for free. `forced()` below is that fast path, and it is why constraining tool
     calls should SPEED UP a tool turn rather than tax it.

── AND THE PART THE GRAMMAR CANNOT FIX, SO IT IS WRITTEN DOWN HERE ─────────────
A grammar makes a call SYNTACTICALLY impossible to get wrong. It does not make it TRUE.
She can still emit a beautifully-formed `add_note("I will look out for a 3090")` when she
has no mechanism to look out for anything. Syntax is not capability. That one is a real
missing tool, not a parser bug, and no amount of masking will conjure it.
